Simple rock, paper, scissors game using javascript to play against a randomly generated computer.


## Description 

When the browser is opened, an alert will ask the player to corfirm if they want to play the game.

If the player does not want to play the game, an alert will pop up to exit the game.

If the player wants to play the game, a prompt will pop up for the player to enter ['rock','paper','scissors'].
If the player does not choose from the given choices, an alert will pop up asking the player if they want to play again.

(This simple game does not account for different iterations of the choices - such as 'rock' != 'ROCK','r','R', etc.)

After the player enters a choice, an alert will pop up showing the computer's choice and the player's choice and if they win, loss, or tie.

After the player confirms the game, the player can confirm if they want to play again.

Each win, loss, and tie is tallied and presented in the closing alert when they finish the game.
